# QNLP

## General goal
```
1. A tangible task (around 100 sentences according to the literature);
2. A task that can be used to compare classical NLP models and QNLP models;
```
## Potential ideas

1. [SICK dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RobZamp/sick): Sharedtask with benchmark dataset, we can pick 100 sentences. [Larry Moss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08772) has been/is working actively on this kind of problem. 
2. [SemEval-2023 Task](https://raganato.github.io/vwsd/): Ambiguous visual labeling (harder but more interesting?). Baseline can be found [here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.semeval-1.308.pdf) with git [repo](https://github.com/asahi417/visual-wsd-baseline).
